# detectifz
DETECTIFz is a galaxy group finder algorithm that detectects groups in multiband photometric galaxy surveys. 

Groups are detected as stellar-mass (M*) overdensities in redshift (z) slices from samples of the PDF_gal(M*,z) of each individual galaxies as outputed by modern photometric redshifts algorithms (e.g. PHOSPHOROS, GalPro).

The group catalogues from Sarron & Conselice (2021) can be found at : https://github.com/fsarron/detectifz_data
